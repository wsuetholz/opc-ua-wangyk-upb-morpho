The feature of security token of smart card provides the perfect storage media for user credential informations. Meanwhile by applying GlobalPlatform standards, smart card is also able to create secure connect with remote administrator  sever and to perform authentication as well secure messaging. 

The newly realized OPC UA specifications provide not only sophisticated object modeling rules which can be used to design domain specific models but also offer a  complex secure policies that help to protect OPC UA application from adversarys' attacks.

The security feature of smart card, OPC UA specifications together with well designed industrial standardization such as GlobalPlatform standards and OpenMobileAPI makes its reliable to design a generic communication and connectivity platform for vendor various secure devices with strong security supports.
