\chapter{Summary and Future Work}\label{secSummary}

With the development of M2M and home automatic control technologies, the in this thesis described Smart Home system will be in popular demand in the near future. But since present-day system is frequently exposed in pervasive computing and ubiquitous networking environment, the concept of security is drawing more and more attentions. 

The security feature of smart card as secure token makes this chip sized circuit card the perfect storage media for user credential information. Meanwhile smart card OS also provides security mechanisms such as key management and secure APDU messaging protocol, which contributes to add an additional secure protection to the system that employs smart card. Moreover by applying well standardized industrial protocols such as RAM/RFM over Http standards from GlobalPlatform and the Simallianceâ€™s OpenMobileAPI, smart card is capable of constructing secure session based connections with remote server and perform dual authentication as well secure messaging with CADs.

The newly released OPC UA specifications provide not only a sophisticated object modelling rules, which can be applied to design domain specific models, but also offer a complex secure policies that have clear security objectives in each lay of system architecture and help to protect OPC UA application from adversary's attacks. 
The in this thesis proposed combination of smart card with OPC UA protocols aims to create a generic communication and connectivity platform for  various vendors manufactured secure devices with strong security supports and consideration. 

In the future, if the study of my proposal goes further, it should be also considered that how to apply the newly proposed LTE technology to benefit the system users with qualified high bandwidth network. Moreover it is also worth thinking, whether it is practical and how to apply Near Field Communication embedded devices in the Smart Home system, for the purpose of providing enhanced secure communication environment, integrating small payment services and etc.

At last, I am grateful for the chance provided by Morpho card Paderborn to write this thesis. Especially I would like to thank Dr. Simon Oberth\"ur, Dr. Stefan Sauer and Castern Rust, who have given me professional advices for my thesis.
