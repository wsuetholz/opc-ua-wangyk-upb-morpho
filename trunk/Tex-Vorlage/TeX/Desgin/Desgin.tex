\chapter{System Design}
As described in previous sections, my demonstration system consists of two main parts, namely the on card integrated  communication stack and android application. Figure~\ref{fig:whole-structure} illustrates the request and corresponding response message exchange  process that occurs in the demonstration system.

\section{UICC Applet}

\subsection{Classes}
My UICC applet is developed on Morpho \emph{SC5-01OS07} LTE SAT product.
Communication stack includes following classes:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item  \emph{CommunicationStack}, which is the main class of my applet, that implements \emph{install}, \emph{select}, \emph{deselect} as well as \emph{process} methods provided by \emph{javacard.framework.Applet}. In order to process remote APDU, this applet is also design as UICC system applet, that extends interface \emph{com.orga.javacard.componentinterfaces.JCISIMApplication}
  \item  \emph{AdminTrigger}, which implements Globalplatform  and toolkitframework interfaces and offers functions for proactive and passive communication session creation with OTA server, cipher suit negotiation and mutual authentication.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{class}

	\label{fig:class}
\end{figure}

\subsection {Communication Flow}

The components involved in this scenario are:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item CommunicationStack applet and associated Security Domain from Globalplatform (APSD  for short)
  \item OTA server which is also known as Remote Administration Server (RAS for short)
\end{itemize}

The communication between CommunicationStack and Remote Administration Server involves following  steps:

 \begin{itemize}
  \item Open Communication Channel and Create Communication Session
  \item Secure Message Exchange
  \item Close Communication Session
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Communication Session Creation and Message Exchange}
This process could be either initiated by Remote Administration Server by sending target applet a trigger SMS or be sponsored by applet itself. In both cases, applet sends the first \emph{OpenChannel Request} message. During the PSK TLS Handshake phase, APSD and remote server will agree on to be used cipher suit and authenticate each other. After a successful PSK TLS Handshake, CommunicationStack and remote OTA server will be able to exchange HTTP message,that encapsulates APDU strings as body, with HTTP header that is in compliance with GlobalPlatform standards.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.2\textwidth]{communication-flow}
		\caption{Class Diagram}
	\label{fig:communication-flow}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{HTTP Header Format}
The HTTP message sent from remote sever to targeted applet uses following schema\cite{gp}:
\begin{verbatim}
HTTP/1.1 200 OK [or HTTP/1.1 204 No Content CRLF]
X-Admin-Protocol: globalplatform-remote-admin/1.0 CRLF
[X-Admin-Next-URI:  <next-URI> CRLF]
[Content-Type: application/vnd.globalplatform.card-content-mgt
-response;version=1.0 CRLF]
[X-Admin-Targeted-Application: <security-domain-AID> CRLF]
[Content-Length: xxxx CRLF] or [Transfer-Encoding: chunked CRLF]
CRLF
[body]
\end{verbatim}
In the field \emph{security-domain-AID} could be filled the AID of targeted applet.


The HTTP response message sent from applet to remote server uses following schema\cite{gp}:
\begin{verbatim}
POST<URI>HTTP/1.1 CRLF
Host: <Administration Host> CRLF
X-Admin-Protocol: globalplatform-remote-admin/1.0 CRLF
X-Admin-From: <Agent ID> CRLF
[Content-Type: application/vnd.globalplatform.card-content-mgt
-response;version=1.0 CRLF]
[Content-Length: xxxx CRLF] or [Transfer-Encoding: chunked CRLF]
[X-Admin-Script-Status: <script-status> CRLF]
[X-Admin-Resume: true]
CRLF
[body]
\end{verbatim}

The filed \emph{X-Admin-Script-Status} could contain following values:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{ok}, which means that the previous message is successfully received by applet.
  \item \emph{unknown-application}, which stands for the error, that the targeted applet for previous message can not be found.
\item \emph{not-a-security-domain}, this errors occurs when targeted applet is not a Security Domain.
\item \emph{security-error}, as its name indicates, this values is returned if the security of previous message  can not be checked.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Close Communication Session}
Whenever the communication channel is about to be closed, either because of session security issue, or due to successful finish of communication, remote server will send target applet HTTP message:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item No \emph{X-Admin-Next-URI} field is present in this HTTP message and message body is empty, which will be recognized as final message from remote server and then the session will be closed.
  \item No \emph{X-Admin-Next-URI} filed is present but in this HTTP message body is not empty. The receiver will process the data in body and close the communication session appropriately. But no response message will be generated.
\end{itemize}

\subsection {Commands: Interface between Applet and CAD}
Before concrete implementation of Javacard applet code, the interface, which in essence is a set of commond APDUs and corresponding response APDUs, between applet and CAD must be well defined.  The CommunicationStack support two categories commond APDU:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item The \emph{SELECT} Command APDU, which is used by JCRE to select CommunicationStack applet.
  \item Other command APDUs, which are introduced in order to provide functionalists such as: trigger communication session, process input APDU and etc. To be more specifically:
\begin{itemize}
  \item PIN operation related APDU set
  \item Communication session management APDU set
  \item Data process APDU set
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{SELECT APDU}
The header of this command APDU is fixed and \emph{Lc} indicates the length of CommunicationStack AID. In \emph{Data filed} real AID is saved.
\begin{table}[!htbp]
\caption{SELECT command APDU}
\scalebox{1.3}{%
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}

\end{tabular}
}
\label{select-apdu}
\end{table}
Two categories of response APDUs are expected, one represents successful processing of \emph{SELECT} command APDU and the other stands for failure.
