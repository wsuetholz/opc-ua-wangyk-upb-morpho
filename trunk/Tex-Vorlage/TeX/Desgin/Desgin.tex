\chapter{System Design} \label{secDesign}


In this chapter, I will present the crucial information about how I designed and programmed my demonstration system. 

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

	\label{fig:whole-structure}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:whole-structure} illustrates the request and corresponding response message exchange process that occurs in the demonstration system. In my scenario, OTA server is also integrated with a \emph{public key infrastructure},  in order to perform secure peer identification and messaging. Therefor this OTA server can also be  generically referred as remote administrator server.


\section{UICC Applet}
\subsection{Overview}
The generic request and response message exchange process shown in figure~\ref{fig:whole-structure} consists of following steps,
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Request Initialization}. As the first step of communication flow, OPC UA client application usually generates the request message and forwards it to the smart card applet \emph{CommunicationStack}.
\item \emph{Open Channel Phase.} Request sender initializes the \emph{open-channel} command and sends this command to the remote administrator server.
\item \emph{TSL Handshake with Remote Server.} After a successful TLS 1.2 based peer identification, a secure communication channel between remote server and message sender is created. And the master key, which is generated during the TLS handshake, is applied to encrypt message exchanged between the aforementioned peers.
\item \emph{Require Target's Public Key.} When remote server identifies the connected communication partner, it will grant him the expected target's public key. 
\item \emph{Secure Messaging.} Message sender will in this phase encrypt the request message with target's public key and send this encrypted message through remote server to the message receiver.
\item \emph{Request Forwarding.} In this step, remote server will send the request receiver a SMS to trigger the construction of a communication channel and use the newly created  secure connection to forward the request message. 
\item \emph{Request Processing.} Upon receiving the request, message receiver decrypts the message using his private key and performs actions based on the in request encapsulated commands. Alternatively, he will also send a response message to the requester.
\end{itemize}
\subsection {Work Flow}

The components involved in this scenario are:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{CommunicationStack} applet and associated Security Domain defined by Globalplatform (APSD  for short)
  \item OTA-PKI server which is also known as Remote Administration Server (RAS for short)
\end{itemize}

The communication between \emph{CommunicationStack} and Remote Administration Server involves following steps:

 \begin{itemize}
  \item Open Communication Channel and Create Communication Session
  \item Secure Message Exchange
  \item Close Communication Session
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Communication Session Creation and Message Exchange}
This process as shown in figure~\ref{fig:communication-flow} could be either initiated by Remote Administration Server by sending target applet a trigger SMS or be sponsored by the applet itself. In both cases, \emph{CommunicationStack} applet sends the first \emph{OpenChannel Request} message encapsulating supported cipher suits, random number and etc. During the PSK-TLS Handshake phase,    \emph{CommunicationStack} and remote server will agree on the to be used cipher suit and authenticate each other. After a successful PSK-TLS Handshake, the aforementioned communication peer is able to generate a master key and use this newly constructed key to encrypt exchanged messages, which can encapsulate APDU command or APDU response strings. The Http header is in compliance with GlobalPlatform standards and is shown as following.


\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{communication-flow}
		\caption{Handshake and Message Exchange between SD and Remote Server}
	\label{fig:communication-flow}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Http Header Format} \label{secHTTPHeader} \label{secHttpHeader}
The Http message sent from remote sever to target applet abides following schema \cite{gp}:
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\relsize{-1}, frame=lines,framesep=4mm, label=\fbox{\small\emph{Http Request Schema}}]
HTTP/1.1 200 OK [or HTTP/1.1 204 No Content CRLF]
X-Admin-Protocol: globalplatform-remote-admin/1.0 CRLF
[X-Admin-Next-URI:  <next-URI> CRLF]
[Content-Type: application/vnd.globalplatform.card-content-mgt
-response;version=1.0 CRLF]
[X-Admin-Targeted-Application: <security-domain-AID> CRLF]
[Content-Length: xxxx CRLF] or [Transfer-Encoding: chunked CRLF]
CRLF
[body]
\end{Verbatim}
The field \emph{security-domain-AID} will be filled with the AID of target applet.


The Http response message sent from applet to remote server uses following schema \cite{gp}:
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\relsize{-1}, frame=lines,framesep=4mm, label=\fbox{\small\emph{Http Response Schema}}]
POST<URI>HTTP/1.1 CRLF
Host: <Administration Host> CRLF
X-Admin-Protocol: globalplatform-remote-admin/1.0 CRLF
X-Admin-From: <Agent ID> CRLF
[Content-Type: application/vnd.globalplatform.card-content-mgt
-response;version=1.0 CRLF]
[Content-Length: xxxx CRLF] or [Transfer-Encoding: chunked CRLF]
[X-Admin-Script-Status: <script-status> CRLF]
[X-Admin-Resume: true]
CRLF
[body]
\end{Verbatim}

The filed \emph{X-Admin-Script-Status} could contain one of following values:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{ok}, which means that the previous message is successfully received by applet.
  \item \emph{unknown-application}, which stands for the error, that the target applet of previous message can not be found.
\item \emph{not-a-security-domain}, this errors occurs when target applet is not a Security Domain.
\item \emph{security-error}, as its name indicates, this values is returned when the security of previous message can not be checked.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Close Communication Session}
Whenever the communication channel is about to be closed, either because of session security issue, or due to the successful finish of communication, remote server will send the target applet a Http message with one of the following parameters:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item No \emph{X-Admin-Next-URI} field is present in this Http message and message body is empty. This message will be recognized as final message from remote server and then the associating session will be closed.
  \item No \emph{X-Admin-Next-URI} filed is presented but the body of this Http message is not empty. The receiver will process the data in body and close the communication session appropriately. But no response message will be generated.
\end{itemize}

\subsection {Commands: Interface between Applet and CAD} \label{secAPDU}
Before concrete implementation of Java Card applet code, the interface, which in essence is a set of commond APDUs and corresponding response APDUs, between applet and CAD must be well defined.  The CommunicationStack support two categories commond APDU:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item The \emph{SELECT} Command APDU, which is used by JCRE to select \emph{CommunicationStack} applet.
  \item Other command APDUs, which are introduced in order to provide functionalists such as: trigger communication session, process input APDU and etc. To be more specifically, following categories of APDU sets are designed :
\begin{itemize}
  \item PIN operation related APDU set
  \item Communication session management APDU set
  \item Data process APDU set
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{SELECT APDU}
The header of this command APDU as shown in table~\ref{select-apdu} is fixed and \emph{Lc} indicates the length of \emph{CommunicationStack} AID. In \emph{Data filed} real AID is saved.

\end{tabular}
}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Verify PIN operation}
This APDU command and response set presented in table~\ref{verify-command-apdu} and~\ref{verify-response-apdu} respectively is used to let \emph{CommunicationStack} applet verify the identity of terminal user. Moreover the PIN size is set from four bits to eight and the verify PIN operation only allows three times wrong PIN input before a successful identification.

\caption{Command Data Type-Length-Value Structure}
\label{tlv}
\end{table}

Based on the in table~\ref{process-data-cmd-apdu} defined command structure, following APDU \emph{A0210000129010910892069C040102030402}\label{remote-apdu-example} can be understood as a command APDU,  which has \emph{class byte} as \emph{A0}, \emph{instruction byte} equals \emph{21}, none \emph{status words}, encapsulates a command data \emph{9010910892069C0401020304} and expects 2 bytes response. The command data can be translated according to table~\ref{tlv} as a command sent by smart phone to the sensor whose unique id is \emph{0x01 0x02 0x03  0x04}, for the purpose of querying current sensor value. Moreover any ill-formed command data will be ignored by the receiver.

\subsection{Classes}\sloppy
My UICC applet shown in figure~\ref{fig:class} is integrated in Morpho \emph{SC5-01OS07} LTE SAT product and contains following classes:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item  \emph{CommunicationStack}, which is the main class of my applet, that implements \emph{install}, \emph{select}, \emph{deselect} as well as \emph{process} methods provided by \emph{javacard.framework.Applet}. Moreover in order to process remote APDU, this applet is also designed as UICC system applet, that extends interface \emph{com.orga.javacard.componentinterfaces.JCISIMApplication}
  \item  \emph{sessionTrigger}, which implements Globalplatform  and toolkitframework interfaces and offers functionalities such as, proactive and passive creation of communication session with remote administrator server, cipher suit negotiation and mutual authentication. \emph{sessionTrigger} is developed based on \emph{adminTrigger} class provided by Morpho.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{class}
		\caption{Class Diagram}
	\label{fig:class}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Class CommunicationStack} \sloppy
As the main class of my Applet, \emph{communicationStack} extends \emph{UsimRemoteService} class provided by Morpho in order to be recognized as a system applet, which is capable of performing remote application/file management behavior. Moreover this main class has implemented interface \emph{JCISIMApplication}, which defines mechanisms to handle remote APDUs.

Also the PIN, which is required when using this applet,  is defined and described as below, 

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\relsize{-1}]
    private static final byte PIN_TRY_LIMIT = (byte) 0x03;
    private static final byte PIN_MAX_SIZE = (byte) 0x08;
    private static final byte PIN_SIZE = (byte) 0x04;
\end{Verbatim}
Every time if a user intends to use this applet, he must pass the PIN examination.
System allows maximum three time wrong PIN input and PIN size is set from four bits to eight.
Following two core methods provided by \emph{communicationStack} is described.
\paragraph{Install Method}
\emph{install} method is used to register my applet in JCRE and create a CommunicationStack implementation.
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\relsize{-2.0}, frame=lines,framesep=4mm, label=\fbox{\small\emph{doVerifyPIN Handler}}]
public static void install( byte[] bArray, short bOffset, byte bLength ) throws ISOException
\end{Verbatim}

\paragraph{process Method} \label{secDummy}
In this method, the received remote APDU command will be analyzed and upon on the encapsulated instruction filed, corresponding handler will be invoked based on the \emph{command data} included in the same command APDU. Following snippet defines how to get \emph{class} filed, \emph{instruction} filed , \emph{command data} and alternatively an normal \emph{APDU} object from a remote APDU object.


\begin{Verbatim}[frame=lines,framesep=4mm, label=\fbox{\small\emph{Remote APDU Operation}}]
byte claMasked = (byte)(anApdu.getCla() & (byte)0xF0);
byte ins = anApdu.getIns();
byte[] cmd = (byte[]) anApdu.getCommandData();	    
short cmdOffset = anApdu.getCommandDataOffset();
byte[] apdu = anApdu.getApdu(); //return APDU object if available
\end{Verbatim}

Based on the acknowledgment of \emph{claMasked} , \emph{ins} data and \emph{apdu} object, using below described switch statement, appropriate handler is invoked.

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=lines,framesep=4mm, label=\fbox{\small\emph{Switch Statement}}]
switch(ins)
	{
	case INS_VERIFYPIN:
		doVerifyPIN(apdu);
	case ....
	}
\end{Verbatim}
In case when \emph{ins} equals \emph{INS\_VERIFYPIN}, following \emph{doVerifyPIN} is invoked.

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\relsize{-1}, frame=lines,framesep=4mm, label=\fbox{\small\emph{doVerifyPIN Handler}}]
private void doVerifyPIN(APDU apdu) {
	byte[] buffer = apdu.getBuffer();
	apdu.setIncomingAndReceive();			
	if(pin.getTriesRemaining() == (byte)0) {
		ISOException.throwIt(SW_PIN_BLOCKED);	
	....
	}
\end{Verbatim}
In total six handlers are designed:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{doVerifyPIN}. As already introduced, this handler performs the verify PIN operation. If the number of wrong PIN input reaches 3 times before a successful verification, \emph{doVerfiyPIN} will block the PIN.
\item \emph{doResetPIN}. This handler realizes PIN change operation.
\item \emph{doUnlockPIN}. \emph{doUnlockPIN} operation will be and only be invoked by card issuer for the purpose of unlock blocked PIN.
\item \emph{doGetPublicKey}. This operation queries target public key from \emph{Public Key infrastructure} which is integrated in OTA server in my scenario.
\item \emph{doNotification}. After receiving notification data, \emph{communicationStack} applet will invoke this handler in order to inform corresponding subscriber to fetch that command data. 
\item \emph{doAppendMsg}. This handler configures and edits the outgoing response remote APDU.
\end{itemize}

Except from status words, if other information is expected to be transmitted back to the command APDU sender,  the return data can be appended at the end of existing response data buffer using following schema.

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\relsize{-2.0}, frame=lines,framesep=4mm, label=\fbox{\small\emph{Editing Response Data}}]
byte[] result = {....};
short length = (short) result.length;
byte[] resBuff = anApdu.getResponseBuffer(); 
short resOffset = anApdu.getResponseBufferOffset();
Util.arrayCopyNonAtomic(result, (short)0, resBuff, (short)resOffset, (short)length);	    
anApdu.setStatusword(State_Word);
anApdu.appendResponse(resBuff,(short)resOffset, (short)length, true);
\end{Verbatim}

Byte array \emph{result} represents the appended data and \emph{resBuff} is the outgoing buffer. 

\subsubsection{Class SessionTrigger}
\emph{sessionTrigger} class extends \emph{HTTPReportListener} interface in order to receive notification upon completion of a session.
\emph{triggerSession} method as shown below provides core mechanism to create a communication session configured by input parameter \emph{byte[] data}.
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\relsize{-2}, frame=lines,framesep=4mm, label=\fbox{\small\emph{Trigger Session}}]
public void triggerSession(byte[] data, short dataOffset, short dataLength )
 {
final short FAMILY_HTTP_ADMINISTRATION = (short) (GPSystem.FAMILY_HTTP_ADMINISTRATION << 8)
GlobalService globalService = GPSystem.getService(null, FAMILY_HTTP_ADMINISTRATION);
HTTPAdministration httpAdmin = (HTTPAdministration)globalService.getServiceInterface
(GPSystem.getRegistryEntry(null),FAMILY_HTTP_ADMINISTRATION, null, (short)0, (short)0);
httpAdmin.requestHTTPAdministrationSession(data, dataOffset, dataLength);
}
\end{Verbatim}

\section{Android Application}
In order to simulate and realize application level  OPC UA functionalities, I have designed the following Android application.


\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{android-class}
		\caption{Android Application Class Diagram}
	\label{fig:android-class}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Utility Classes}
The Application class diagram is shown in figure ~\ref{fig:android-class}. And in order to encapsulate commonly re-used functions, following utility classes are employed.
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{CmdTranslate}. This class provides methods such as \emph{getCmd}, \emph{getCmdTlv} and \emph{byteArrayToHexString}, which are used to translate user commands into byte arrays based on rules defined in section~\ref{secAPDU}.
\item \emph{JSONParser}. With support provided by \emph{org.apache.http} and \emph{org.json} packages, \emph{JSONParse} class offers mechanisms to generate Http POST and GET request. Moreover method \emph{makeHttpRequest} in this class returns a Json object including query result as well as return code.
\item \emph{UiDesign}. Based on package \emph{android.graphic} and \emph{android.text}, this class provides the approach to realize customized UI layout. For instance, in method \emph{getStyle(String text, int begin, int end, String Farbe)}, the text between \emph{begin} and \emph{end} position is granted with a given color,  \emph{Farbe}. A concrete usage case is demonstrated in figure~\ref{fig:get-style}

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{get-style.jpg}
		\caption{Customized Text Color for the Command Result}
	\label{fig:get-style}
\end{figure}

\end{itemize} 
\subsection{Layout} \label{secLayout}
Under \emph{root$\backslash$res$\backslash$layout} directory, the \emph{xml} files that define layout frameworks of my application activities are presented. To be more specifically,
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{welcome.xml}. The UI-layout of welcome screen is described, where user can input his password and username.
\item \emph{main.xml}, which defines the layout of application main screen.
\item \emph{list\_item.xml} and \emph{record.xml}. Those two xml files together picture how to present historical record in a list arranged by date.
\item \emph{block.xml}. The PIN block screen is defined by \emph{block.xml}
\end{itemize}
The screen-shots of my Android application will be presented in next chapter \emph{Implementation Test}.


\subsection{Activity Classes}
Activity class extends \emph{android.app.Activity} and implements interface \emph{SEService.CallBack} provided by Simalliance OpenMobileAPI with whose help one activity is able to send instructions and receive call-back from smart card. 
\subsubsection{Seek for Android} \label{secSFA}
Seek for Android is a smart card API that implements Simalliance OpenMobileAPI standards which grants Android application the ability to communicate with secure elements such as smart card. Package \emph{org.simalliance.openmobileapi} is the code realization of aforementioned specifications.

In order to communicate with the smart card, the \emph{SEService} constructor must be generated, which provides the method \emph{getReaders} returning a list of available connected secure elements. If one \emph{reader} is selected, then with the help of \emph{openSession} method, one particular session will be created between the selected secure element and the application. At last this \emph{session} is capable of getting access to a logical channel on the connected secure element by applying \emph{openLogicalChannel} method with AID as input parameter. Following code snippet demonstrates the service and logical channel creation process \cite{open}.

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\relsize{-1},frame=lines,framesep=4mm, label=\fbox{\small\emph{Service and Logical Channel Creation}}]
void performSelectOpt(SEService service) {
Reader[] readers = service.getReaders();
cardreader = readers[0].getName();
boolean isPresent = readers[0].isSecureElementPresent();
Session session = readers[0].openSession();
final byte[] hellosimcard = new byte[] {AID};
logicalChannel = session.openLogicalChannel(hellosimcard);
performOpenOpt(service);
}
\end{Verbatim}
After a successful creation of the logical channel, one Android application is able to send command to and get response from a secure element using \emph{bytep[] result = logicalChannel.tramsmit(cmdApdu)}.
\subsubsection{Layout Adoption}
Activity class adopts the layout defined in section~\ref{secLayout} during the activity creation phase.

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\relsize{-1},frame=lines,framesep=4mm, label=\fbox{\small\emph{Layout Adoption}}]
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
// set Layout
setContentView(R.layout.main);
\end{Verbatim}

\subsubsection{AsyncTask}
Since the \emph{HttpResponse} message could be delivered to \emph{activity} which sends the  corresponding \emph{HttpRequest} message with latency, therefore for the purpose of simplified UI thread operations, the interface \emph{AsyncTask} is employed in my application.

Following code snippet demonstrates class, that is used to perform the sensor subscription value update operation. 
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\relsize{-1},frame=lines,framesep=4mm, label=\fbox{\small\emph{AsyncTask HttpRequest}}]
class RecordUpdate extends AsyncTask<String, String, String> {
protected void onPreExecute() {}	
protected String doInBackground(String... params) {
runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {
public void run() {
...
JSONObject json = jsonParser.makeHttpRequest(url_update_record, "GET", params);
...
\end{Verbatim}
\subsubsection{Intent}
As already in section~\ref{secIntent} introduced, intent builds data sharing system between activities. Following code segment describes how \emph{ValidationActivity} class perform page jump based on \emph{performVerifyOpt} result.
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\relsize{-1},frame=lines,framesep=4mm, label=\fbox{\small\emph{Intent}}]
Intent intent = new Intent();           			  	
verifyResult = performVerifyOpt(scservice);
if (verifyResult == 1){
intent.setClass(Validation.this, MainActivity.class);  
startActivity(intent);  
finish(); }
if (verifyResult == 3){
intent.setClass(Validation.this, BlockActivity.class);  
startActivity(intent);  
finish(); }
\end{Verbatim}
\subsubsection{Activities Overview}
Following four activities together build my Android application.
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{ValidationActivity}. Whose major task is to perform user authentication based on input user-name and password.
\item \emph{BlockActivity}. After three times of failed user identification, my application will invoke this \emph{BlockActivity} and accordingly block the PIN.
\item \emph{MainActivity}. This class realizes client functions defined in section~\ref{secFunction}
\item \emph{RecordActivity}. With the help of \emph{RecordActivity}, user is capable of querying and viewing system historical data.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{AndroidManifest}
\emph{AndroidManifest} encapsulates all necessary information which is required by Android OS. Such as composing components information, component access permissions and necessary applied libraries \cite{android_manifest}. In order to provide a secure application environment, in my \emph{AndroidManifest}, only the \emph{ValidationActivity} can be launched by Android system and always runs as the initial task. Moreover, none \emph{intent-filters} are declared for my activities, which means activities from my application can only be started or visited by the explicit intent sent by \emph{ValidationActivity}, the AndroidManifest snippet is shown as below.
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\relsize{-1},frame=lines,framesep=4mm, label=\fbox{\small\emph{AndroidManifest.xml}}]
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
	android:versionCode="1"
	android:versionName="1.0" package="org.simalliance.openmobileapi.test">
 <application android:label="@string/app_name" android:debuggable="true">
  <activity android:name=".ValidationActivity"
 		android:label="@string/app_name">
	<intent-filter>
		<action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
		<category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
	</intent-filter>
 </activity>
      
 <activity android:name=".MainActivity"
	android:label="@string/app_name"
	android:exported='false'>
 </activity>
....
 </application>
</manifest> 
\end{Verbatim}

\section{Smart Home Web Server} \label{secWEB}
Smart Home web application is also designed for the purpose of testing my smart card applet, Android application as well as simulating Smart Home housing devices, especially the data information maintained by them. Apache 2.4.9 together with PHP of version 5.5.12 and MySQL database build my web application.  

\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{Images/design/overview.jpg}
		\caption{Smart Home Web Overview screen-shot}
	\label{fig:smart-home-frontpage}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:logo} is the logo that I designed for my web application. And Figure~\ref{fig:smart-home-frontpage} illustrates the web page that shows state information of three housing devices. Each housing device has its own table in MySQL database. Moreover, user can navigate to other pages by clicking the blue tabs on top right of this page. For instance, by clicking \emph{Record} button, user is able to bowser historical record of each home device. 
Detailed design information has limited relation with the subject of this thesis, therefor will not be presented.

\section{Conclusion}

In this chapter, I have presented how I designed and implemented my different system components with  focus on \emph{CommunicationStack} applet and \emph{Smart Home App}. Moreover a brief introduction of my Smart Home web application is also given. In the next chapter, I am going to present how I designed system implementation tests, which are introduced together with  the test results for the purpose of proofing the reliability and feasibility of my proposal.
