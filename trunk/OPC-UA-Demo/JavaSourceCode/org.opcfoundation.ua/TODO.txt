UA Stack Tasks and Todos
------------------------ 

* Document

* Performance Tuning
    Use profiler tool (JProfiler or jvisualvm) to search for performance bottle necks 
    and to verify that there are no memory leaks.

* Security 
     Add missing security policies
	     SecurityPolicy.Basic128
	     SecurityPolicy.Basic192
	     SecurityPolicy.Basic192Rsa15
	     SecurityPolicy.Basic256Rsa15

* Examples
    Tutorial/Example How to generate certificate instance

* Application 
    Discover Server
    SessionManager
    SubscriptionManager
    NodeManager

* Interoperability
    Test Java Client to C Server Service interoperability
    Test Java Client to C# Server Service interoperability
    Test C Client to Java Server Service interoperability
    Test C# Client to Java Server Service interoperability
    Test Java Client to C Server Session interoperability
    Test Java Client to C# Server Session interoperability
    Test C Client to Java Server Session interoperability
    Test C# Client to Java Server Session interoperability

* Soap 
    SecureChannel
    EndpointSecureChannel 
 
* Serializer re-work
    XML Serialization
    EncodeableSerializer to smaller classes.
        EncodeableSerializer is one huge class that initializes serializers for all classes.
        This consumes memory and adds load time.
        Refactor so that serializers are loaded on-demand.         
    Support for 3rd party stub classes
        The library at https://www.simantics.org/wiki/index.php/Datatype can solve this problem (and the one above)        
    Make IEncodeables implement java.io.Serializable 
 
* UnitTests
     BinaryEncoder & BinaryDecoder
     SecureChannelTcp
     ...

* Search and fix all TODO:s and XXX:s
        
* Client
    Add Multi-Thread cipher encoder&Decoding to client (again)
    SecureChannel reattachment doesn't work with C# (works with C)
 
* Server Code
    Sequence Number Wrapping (it doesn't work at 2^32 - 1024)
    Remove RuntimeExceptions
    (Done, jaro/Mantis #1210, build 305) Fix re-attaching to secure channel
    Rewrite the state-class. 
    Better errors
      Better Error handling.
      Better Error messages. 
      (Done, jaro, build 305) Send StackFaults over the wire.
